Regarding this file, I will write  "a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data".

First of all we have the tidy dataset. Which is composed of 180 rows and 82 columns.

 "SubjectID" which can take values from 1-30 (integer variable)
 
 "ActivityID" which can take numbers from 1 - 6 and they mean (factor variable):         
          1            WALKING
          2   WALKING_UPSTAIRS
          3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
          4            SITTING
          5           STANDING
          6             LAYING
   
 And then we have the following, each measures a different variable and are all numeric. The values represented are the average values of each variable for each activity and each subject.
