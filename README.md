# GettingandCleaningDataCourseProject
Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on coursera offered by Johns Hopkins University

This is the REPO for final assignment of the Getting and Cleaning data course. In order to achieve this we had to:
1. Download zip file
2. Unzip file
3. Read its content into our working directory
4. Since the zip file had multiple txt files, merge them into one
5. Manipulate the data 
6. Write a txt file with the "tidy" data

Some of these steps were to happen inside a function called "Run_analysis.R"
What this function should do was specified by:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
